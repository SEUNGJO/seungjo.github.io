<h1>SEUNGJAE BENJAMIN OH</h1>

<p>
I am a fresh graduated student from UCLA, class of 2019 and major in Applied mathematics. I am specially interested in data analyzing. It should be related to the data science being powerfully by machine and deep learning. Moreover, Business and financial analysis is also my specialties.
I am a technology enthusiast who wishes to indulge in the industries where innovative minds work to bring forth changes. My academic background in Applied Mathematics has served to enhance my analytical, statistical, and technical attributes. Work experiences from diverse fields have not only fostered teamwork and leadership, but also shaped me to become a dynamic candidate. I am a self-motivated and avid learner and I look forward to future challenges and opportunities.
I have spent the past year doing number crunching and database management, and I am keen to continue developing my career in the field of data analysis. I have always been a numbers person, with exceptional mathematics and computer skills. I am fluent in a number of data management systems and software, including Excel and mySQL, and data-driven optimization are the rhythm of the drumbeat I march to.
As much as I am into data manipulation, it is the analysis of data that really gets me going. I like to explore the relationships between numbers, and translate digits and spreadsheets into stories. In the age of big data, these stories become actionable solutions and strategies for businesses, and I take pride in my ability to make data accessible to both executive decision-makers and frontline sales staff.
On a personal level, I am detail-oriented, organized, and precise in my work. I also have strong communication skills with a knack for clear and illuminating presentation. I am comfortable on my own facing the numbers, but I really enjoy being part of a motivated team of smart people.

Sincerely,
