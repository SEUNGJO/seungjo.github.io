<p>
  This is a mathematical Eco System Modeling Project class of MATH-142 in FALL 2016 at UCLA. It was being with the professor <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~amiroshn/" > Alexey Miroshinkov</a>.</br> 
  <br> The reference of this project is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Models-Mechanical-Vibrations-Mathematics/dp/0898714087"> Haberman, R., Mathematical Models, Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.</a></br>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p> To plot phase trajectories ( asked in the exercises below) use any computer software capable of plotting vector fields or isoclines (for instance MatLab or Mathematica).</p>
