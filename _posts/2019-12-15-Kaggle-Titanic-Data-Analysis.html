<p>
  This is the legendary Titanic ML competition â€“ the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.
  The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
  The reference of this kernel is <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic">here</a>. and you also could download the datasets there.

<h2> Set up the Project </h2>
<p>
  this tutorial will analyze the suvival rate of people who were taken the titanic ship in terms of their profiles.
  This tutorial will be used by multiple visual tools as matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly. Also, it will be analized by pandas and numpy and sklearn as a machine learning tool.
  Basically, the process will be six steps.
  First, Discovering the dataset.
  Second, Analyzing datas each others.
  third,
